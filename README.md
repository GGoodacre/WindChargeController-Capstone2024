# WindChargeController-Capstone2024
Wind Charge Controller for BEng Capstone 2024

## Objective
To develop a low cost, all-in-one Wind Charge Controller that caters to the average residential consumer considering wind power as a viable energy source for any relatively low power operations (<1kW).
This can be broken down into 3 main components:
* MPPT Formula
  *  We aim to make a Maximum Power Point Tracking algorithm specifically tuned for use with small scale wind turbines to maximimize efficiency and also very importantly, reduce turbine noise pollution 
* User Accessibility
  *  It is important for the product to be simple to install to cater to our target audience. Measures will be taken to design an intuitive interface and provide clear, user-friendly instructions, ensuring that even individuals with limited technical expertise can effortlessly install and operate the equipment
* Integration of additional devices
  *  We wish to offer users a seamless plug-and-play experience with other devices by utilizing the Victron environment and allowing integration with, for example, solar panels to ease the sporadic nature of wind power.

## LTspice
### System Overview
To get the LTspice simulation to run
1) Open "LTSpice\WCC\windchargecontroller.asc"
2) Go to "Tools > Control Panel > SPICE" and change "Solver" to "Alternate"
3) Copy paste the following into "Tools > Control Panel > Sym. & Lib. Search Paths > Symbol Search Path[*]"

>..\WCC_lib

### Benchmark
To get the benchmarks to run
1) Open "LTSpice\Benchmark\" and Open the file you want
2) Go to "Tools > Control Panel > SPICE" and change "Solver" to "Alternate"
3) Copy paste the following into "Tools > Control Panel > Sym. & Lib. Search Paths > Symbol Search Path[*]"

>..\WCC_lib
